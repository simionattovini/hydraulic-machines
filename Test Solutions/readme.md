My apologies to all the users who don't speak portuguese. I teach in Brazil, where Portuguese is the official language. Therefore, all my tests and their solutions are in Portuguese. I try to keep as much os my material as I can in english, so that the community is able to use it, but in this particular case, Portuguese is mandatory.

Best regards to all and keep studying!
